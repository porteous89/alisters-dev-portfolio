# alisters-dev-portfolio - Module 2



## Description

This is a "Start from scratch" challenge, I am given no starting code and must make a web application to display my furutre web dev portfolio.
The Challenge contains a User Story and an Acceptance Criteria to define the parameters I had to follow to complete it.
By completing this challenge I have used recently learned skills such as flexbox, media queries and CSS Variables, also I have ensured the website contains my name, avatar, links to the sections form the navbar, a portfolio section and a contact section.

I found this challenge quite difficult to get a handle on, with a lot of work going into the flexbox and responsive resizing of the page. It has greatly improved my knowledge of CSS flaxbox as it took quite some time to go through each change ensuring it wasn't having a knock on affect elsewhere in the code.

Here is the criteria for the project:

### User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
